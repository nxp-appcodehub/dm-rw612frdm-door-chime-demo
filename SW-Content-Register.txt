Description and comments:   Demo Application  shows how to implement a wireless door chime with the RW612-FRDM board.							
                            The chime is controlled over Wi-Fi with the MQTT application protocol. 
                            Chime sound data is streamed on the I2S pins of the RW612-FRDM Arduino header. 
                            An external codec and also an amplifier are required to play the sound on an external speaker.
